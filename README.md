CS-4331 - Special Topic in Software Engineering - Texas Tech University Fall 2017 <br /><br />
This project is to demonstrate the implementation of the Privacy by Design (PbD) concept in Andriod Application (FastChatApp). 
For this project we have used the OpenSource Application from this link. <br />

We have modified the application and implemented some of the features with PbD Principles including hashing user password using Bcrypt algorithm to store in Firebase database.
